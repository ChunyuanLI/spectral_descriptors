SGWT : Spectral Graph Wavelets Toolbox
(c) David Hammond, 2010

Primary Author : David Hammond (hammond@uoregon.edu)

This toolbox contains code implementing the Spectral Graph Wavelet
Transform, a general framework for defining wavelet transforms for
data defined on vertices of a weighted graph. The algorithms
implemented here are described in detail in

Installation of the toolbox is simple, simply unpack the directory. 
For convenience you may edit the file sgwt_setpath.m to set the
SGWT_ROOT to the path of the sgwt_toolbox directory

Executing the script sgwt_setpath then adds all the needed paths to
the matlab search path.

Then, you may try running the demo's 

>> sgwt_demo1

>> sgwt_demo2

>> sgwt_demo3
