% sgwt_demo3 : Image decomposition with SGWT wavelets based on local adjacency.
%
% This demo builds the SGWT transform on a graph representing 
% adjacency on a pixel mesh with 4-nearest neighbor connectivity.
% This demonstrates inverse on problem with large dimension.
%
% The demo loads an image file and decomposes the image with the SGWT,
% showing the coefficients as images at each scale. The demo does not show
% the individual wavelets (this could be done by replacing the input 
% image by a "delta image" with a single unit nonzero pixel) .
%
% The inverse is then computed, from the original coefficients as well as 
% from a modified set of coefficients where only coefficients at one
% scale are preserved. This shows that the SGWT can generate a
% multiresolution decomposition for images. We don't claim that this
% particular local-adjacency based transform is better for image
% processing than other available wavelet image decompositions, but it
% demonstrates the flexibility of the SGWT.
