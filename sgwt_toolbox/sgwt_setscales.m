% sgwt_setscales : Compute a set of wavelet scales adapted to spectrum bounds
%
% function s=sgwt_setscales(lmin,lmax,Nscales)
% 
% returns a (possibly good) set of wavelet scales given minimum nonzero and 
% maximum eigenvalues of laplacian
% 
% returns scales logarithmicaly spaced between minimum and maximum
% "effective" scales : i.e. scales below minumum or above maximum
% will yield the same shape wavelet (due to homogoneity of sgwt kernel : 
% currently assuming sgwt kernel g given as abspline with t1=1, t2=2)
%
% Inputs : 
% lmin,lmax - minimum nonzero and maximum eigenvalue of
%             Laplacian. Note that in design of transform with
%             scaling function, lmin may be taken just as a fixed
%             fraction of lmax,  and may not actually be the
%             smallest nonzero eigenvalue 
% Nscales - # of wavelet scales
%
% Outputs :
% s - wavelet scales
